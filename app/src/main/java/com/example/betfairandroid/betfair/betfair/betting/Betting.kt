     * Returns a list of your current orders. Optionally you can filter and sort your current orders using the various
     * parameters, setting none of the parameters will return all of your current orders up to a maximum of 1000 bets,
     * ordered BY_BET and sorted EARLIEST_TO_LATEST. To retrieve more than 1000 orders, you need to make use of the
     * fromRecord and recordCount parameters.
     *
     * To efficiently track new bet matches from a specific time, customers should use a combination of the dateRange,
     * orderBy "BY_MATCH_TIME" and orderProjection “ALL” to filter fully/partially matched orders from the list of
     * returned bets. The response will then filter out any bet records that have no matched date and provide a list of
     * betIds in the order which they are fully/partially matched from the date and time specified in the dateRange
     * field.
     *
     * @param betIds: Optionally restricts the results to the specified bet IDs. A maximum of 250 betId's, or a
     * combination of 250 betId's & marketId's are permitted.
     * @param marketIds: Optionally restricts the results to the specified market IDs. A maximum of 250 marketId's, or a
     * combination of 250 marketId's & betId's are permitted.
     * @param orderProjection: Optionally restricts the results to the specified order status.
     * @param customerOrderRefs: Optionally restricts the results to the specified customer order references.
     * @param customerStrategyRefs: Optionally restricts the results to the specified customer strategy references.
     * @param dateRange: Optionally restricts the results to be from/to the specified date, these dates are contextual
     * to the orders being returned and therefore the dates used to filter on will change to placed, matched, voided or
     * settled dates depending on the orderBy. This date is inclusive, i.e. if an order was placed on exactly this date
     * (to the millisecond) then it will be included in the results. If the from is later than the to, no results will
     * be returned.
     * @param orderBy: Specifies how the results will be ordered. If no value is passed in, it defaults to BY_BET.  Also
     * acts as a filter such that only orders with a valid value in the field being ordered by will be returned (i.e.
     * BY_VOID_TIME returns only voided orders, BY_SETTLED_TIME (applies to partially settled markets) returns only
     * settled orders and BY_MATCH_TIME returns only orders with a matched date (voided, settled, matched orders)). Note
     * that specifying an orderBy parameter defines the context of the date filter applied by the dateRange parameter
     * (placed, matched, voided or settled date) - see the dateRange parameter description (above) for more information.
     * See also the OrderBy type definition.
     * @param sortDir: Specifies the direction the results will be sorted in. If no value is passed in, it defaults to
     * EARLIEST_TO_LATEST.
     * @param fromRecord: Specifies the first record that will be returned. Records start at index zero, not at index
     * one.
     * @param recordCount: Specifies how many records will be returned from the index position 'fromRecord'. Note that
     * there is a page size limit of 1000. A value of zero indicates that you would like all records (including and from
     * 'fromRecord') up to the limit.
