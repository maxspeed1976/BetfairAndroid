/**
 * Instruction to place a new order
 *
 * @property orderType: (required)
 * @property selectionId: (required) The selection_id.
 * @property handicap: The handicap associated with the runner in case of Asian handicap markets (e.g. marketTypes
 * ASIAN_HANDICAP_DOUBLE_LINE, ASIAN_HANDICAP_SINGLE_LINE) null otherwise.
 * @property side: (required) Back or Lay
 * @property limitOrder: A simple exchange bet for immediate execution
 * @property limitOnCloseOrder: Bets are matched if, and only if, the returned starting price is better than a specified
 * price. In the case of back bets, LOC bets are matched if the calculated starting price is greater than the specified
 * price. In the case of lay bets, LOC bets are matched if the starting price is less than the specified price. If the
 * specified limit is equal to the starting price, then it may be matched, partially matched, or may not be matched at
 * all, depending on how much is needed to balance all bets against each other (MOC, LOC and normal exchange bets)
 * @property marketOnCloseOrder: Bets remain unmatched until the market is reconciled. They are matched and settled at a
 * price that is representative of the market at the point the market is turned in-play. The market is reconciled to
 * find a starting price and MOC bets are settled at whatever starting price is returned. MOC bets are always matched
 * and settled, unless a starting price is not available for the selection. Market on Close bets can only be placed
 * before the starting price is determined
 * @property customerOrderRef: An optional reference customers can set to identify instructions.. No validation will be
 * done on uniqueness and the string is limited to 32 characters. If an empty string is provided it will be treated as
 * null.
