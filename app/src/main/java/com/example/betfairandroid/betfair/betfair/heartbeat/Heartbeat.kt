    /**
     * This heartbeat operation is provided to help customers have their positions managed automatically in the event of
     * their API clients losing connectivity with the Betfair API. If a heartbeat request is not received within a
     * prescribed time period, then Betfair will attempt to cancel all 'LIMIT' type bets for the given customer on the
     * given exchange. There is no guarantee that this service will result in all bets being cancelled as there are a
     * number of circumstances where bets are unable to be cancelled. Manual intervention is strongly advised in the
     * event of a loss of connectivity to ensure that positions are correctly managed. If this service becomes
     * unavailable for any reason, then your heartbeat will be unregistered automatically to avoid bets being
     * inadvertently cancelled upon resumption of service. you should manage your position manually until the service is
     * resumed. Heartbeat data may also be lost in the unlikely event of nodes failing within the cluster, which may
     * result in your position not being managed until a subsequent heartbeat request is received.
     *
     * @param preferredTimeoutSeconds: (required) Maximum period in seconds that may elapse (without a subsequent
     * heartbeat request), before a cancellation request is automatically submitted on your behalf. The minimum value is
     * 10, the maximum value permitted is 300. Passing 0 will result in your heartbeat being unregistered (or ignored if
     * you have no current heartbeat registered). You will still get an actionPerformed value returned when passing 0,
     * so this may be used to determine if any action was performed since your last heartbeat, without actually
     * registering a new heartbeat. Passing a negative value will result in an error being returned, INVALID_INPUT_DATA.
     * Any errors while registering your heartbeat will result in a error being returned, UNEXPECTED_ERROR. Passing a
     * value that is less than the minimum timeout will result in your heartbeat adopting the minimum timeout. Passing a
     * value that is greater than the maximum timeout will result in your heartbeat adopting the maximum timeout. The
     * minimum and maximum timeouts are subject to change, so your client should utilise the returned
     * actualTimeoutSeconds to set an appropriate frequency for your subsequent heartbeat requests.
     * @throws APINGException
